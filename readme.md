This is a calculator for subnets and it sends the result of the calculation using data frame. I got this idea from a youtube video.
The formula for this is, usable hosts. So /24 as an example means 32 bit - the 24 bit (the CIDR) means the last 8 bits are for hosts portion
2 ^ 8 = 256, thats the total address. but we have to reserve the network and broadcast addresses so we have 256- 2 = so only 254 usablehopst ip address
